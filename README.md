First, Physical computing means creating an interactive physical system by using software and hardware that can feel and react to the analog world. Although this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart car traffic control systems and factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader concept, physical computing is a creative framework that understands the relationship between humans and the digital world. Substantially, the term generally refers to handicrafts, designs, and DIY hobby projects that convert analog inputs into software systems using sensors and microcontrollers or control electromechanical devices such as motors and lighting.
Physical computing crosses the scope of activity in academic and industrial fields such as electrical airports, mechatronics, robotics, computer science, especially embedded development.
