Shredinger's Cats?


Physical computing 
means creating an interactive physical system by using software and hardware that can feel and react to the analog world. Although this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart car traffic control systems and factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader concept, physical computing is a creative framework that understands the relationship between humans and the digital world. Substantially, the term generally refers to handicrafts, designs, and DIY hobby projects that convert analog inputs into software systems using sensors and microcontrollers or control electromechanical devices such as motors and lighting.
Physical computing crosses the scope of activity in academic and industrial fields such as electrical airports, mechatronics, robotics, computer science, especially embedded development.

Personal Thoughts: <Parallel computing and Shredinger's thoughts on cats>
In fact, I am not capable of mentioning this topic, but I think there is such a relationship recently, so I’m going to briefly write about it.
It is very difficult to have intelligence to predict the future or control the universe. Considering the physical basis, a small decision in this world may have a tremendous impact on the other world or have nothing to do with it, just like the story that the wings of a Beijing butterfly could cause a typhoon in the United States.
Assuming that the future can be predicted physically, all variables must be considered, and the degree to which the motion and influence of the variables are influenced and the current state must be accurately known.

Even if the number of atoms in the universe is less than 2^280 and even those particles have information, it seems difficult to predict or control the future unless the motion and effects of all these particles are fixed to some extent.
There is also a story that the universe is in the form of a virtual computer.
If computing does not fix the processing category and scope of the data to some extent, the data will be flooded.
Therefore, movements and exercises that are not related to each other should be fixed assuming that they do not affect each other.

Schredinger's cat, an accident experiment made in 1935, is said to be a cat that may or may not die due to radiation decay. The cat exists in a state where we may or may not die if we do not observe.
But is it possible to exist like that in common sense? From common sense, I'm dead. Or is it possible to exist in a state where it is undecided that it has not died or lived until we observe the cat?
I think that's possible in physics these days. It's contrary to common sense. But why does this happen in the natural world?
What has been said so far is personal speculation about why it will happen.

With the increasing integration of computing CPUs these days, performance has improved enough to simulate the entire small physical space. The gate size has become 1 trillion gates and is 10,000 times the size of our old 586 computers.

If the computer moves faster, the current small physical space will expand to a level that can be predicted in the future. In other words, it is simply to see the future.
In other words, if the level of computing really develops indefinitely, it is possible to predict that the size of that small physical space is the size of the universe.
The problem is that the transfer of particles or waves becomes easy to compute only when there is no interaction or activity in some environments.

In other words, when interaction is limited, parallel computing is applied, and if there is interaction, parallel computing becomes impossible.
For example, assuming that particle 1 is on one side of the Earth and particle 2 on the other side of the Earth, it means that if there is no observation between the particles, there is no energy exchange between them, then parallel computing is possible.
If they affect each other, parallel computing is impossible, and if they are not related to each other, they can be calculated as parallel cores. In other words, unlimited parallel cores with limited interparticle interference can simulate and predict the universe.

The world we don't observe doesn't affect us. Isn't this the principle of moving the universe and whether parallel computing can be applied or not?
Isn't it a little too much to say that we exist in a huge matrix and that there is such a law of physics to prevent the overflow of information by interaction from being out of control?
Wouldn't the creator make it like that indirectly? I wonder if it's because I'm a Christian.
This is a very difficult story to verify, but I wrote a long story that I didn't know and no one else knew.

What do you think about it?

How should Physical Computing’s future be
In one sentence it would be, Converging new generation IT technology with old generation electronics and mechanical engineering experiences

If you agree with the optimistic outlook for the future of physical computing, what industrial strategies should society establish and implement?

First, it is necessary to establish a system in which young people can inherit the experience of senior groups, which have considerable experience in electronic and mechanical engineering. Like other generations, baby boomers have both merit and department. The retirement baby boomers' experience in electronic and mechanical engineering should not be lost.

Second, the organizational structure and culture must be restructured according to the transformation into a knowledge society. Physical computing must combine various majors and knowledge. Silo between corporate departments as well as between government ministries must collapse. Organizational structure, performance evaluation, and organizational culture must be transformed for the free distribution and linkage of knowledge.

Third, digital capabilities should be developed by the highest decision makers and policy makers. In a situation where digital general-purpose technology is increasing exponentially, if decision makers do not have digital capabilities, it is no different from operating express buses without a driver's license.

Future physical computing game? 
(Below article is written in 2142)
There are numerous physical phenomenas in computer games. In particular, in the case of action games, racing games, or physical simulation games, it is no exaggeration to say that the basic mechanism itself is controlled by physical phenomena.

Microphysical computing refers to a technology that implements physical phenomena occurring in a game using actual physical space instead of implementing them with abstract numerical values. For example, the CPU/GPU does not calculate the act of dropping a ball in the air based on a vector, but drops the real ball in the existing physical space and outputs the result value in real time in the game screen.

Microphysical computing technology, as its name suggests, performs this physical experiment in a very small micro-scale space. Inside a finger-sized chip made for microphysical computing, there is a vacuum tube filled with fine metal dust that can be controlled by electrical signals, in which all the physical objects currently appearing in the game are implemented in micro-scale, tiny stereoscopic models.

The physical interaction between these models is precisely interpreted by the real-time 3D scanner surrounding the tube and transmitted to the game program in the form of input values.
